# Summary
This simplified scripts folder was used to simplify the voe pipeline for a study done on the relationship between type 2 diabetes and the microbiome. 
1. 2020_T2D_Data contains input data related to our study.
2. Example_Data is merely a copy of the data from the example_scripts folder of microbiome_voe (go back one folder to see it)
3. Additional_Help_documents is a folder that contains some Word files that explain a few of the trickier R scripts. It breaks down what the inputs and outputs are, as well as what some of the tricker functions and lines of code do.
